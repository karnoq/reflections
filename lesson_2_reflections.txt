What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A message will appear indicating that an (empty) Git repository is created wherever the user has specified.
This creates a hidden file that will contain the meta-data that Git uses to track changes, etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it
offers?

The staging area is similar to a temporary directory where you can add or remove files before committing
them fully to the repository. This provides a benefit by allowing you to change your mind about which file(s)
to include into the repository at this time.
